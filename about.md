*Arcadia* is a personal collection of poems composed by [me](http://gianlucacosta.info/about): they are mostly surreal texts, written in ancient Italian an modern French, dealing with philosophical and romantic themes.

Arcadia also features an [e-book]({{site.baseurl}}/e-book) containing all the poems published from June 2013 to June 2014.
