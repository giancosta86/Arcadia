*Arcadia* is a collection of poems on [my website](http://gianlucacosta.info/); it also features an e-book containing all the poems that I've published from June 2013 to June 2014.

Arcadia is mainly in ancient Italian and modern French - for futher information, please consult [the e-book introduction](intro).

## About the e-book

Arcadia is free and is compatible with a great variety of readers, both hardware and software.

For most devices, you'll likely have to download the e-book file and upload it to your reader, via file manager or via a dedicated app: the exact steps, however, may vary.


## Publication dates

The publication dates for poems belonging to the e-book do not correspond to the original publication dates - instead, they have been assigned to match the conceptual order defined in the e-book.
