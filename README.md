# Arcadia

*Dreams and poetry*


This is the GitHub project page for [Arcadia](http://gianlucacosta.info/Arcadia), my web project devoted to dreams, poems and philosophy: here, you can browse the source files of both the website and the e-book.


You are all invited to [visit Arcadia](http://gianlucacosta.info/Arcadia)! ^\_\_^
